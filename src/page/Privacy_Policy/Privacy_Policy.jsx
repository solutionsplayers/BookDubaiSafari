        <List txt="Purpose" />
        <Paragraph>
          This document sets out our policy for responding to requests for

        <Paragraph>
          An individual has the right to erasure, also known as ‘the right to be
          forgotten’. The principle underpinning this right is to enable an
          individual to request the deletion or removal of personal data where
          there is no compelling reason for its continued processing.
        </Paragraph>
        <List txt="When does the right to erasure apply?" />
        <Paragraph>
          As stipulated in UK data protection law, individuals have a right to
          have personal data erased and to prevent processing in specific
          circumstances:

          Data may still remain in the systems back-up files, which will be
          deleted periodically.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          We undertake to perform the deletion within one month (30 calendar
          days) and will send you a confirmation once the information has been
          deleted. Wherever possible, we will aim to complete the request in
